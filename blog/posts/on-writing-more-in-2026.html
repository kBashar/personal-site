        <!-- ── Post body ──────────────────────────────────────── -->
        <div class="post-body prose">
          <p>I've started and abandoned a blog three times in the last five years. Each time the pattern was the same: burst of enthusiasm, two or three posts, then silence for six months, then an awkward "I'm back!" post that led nowhere.</p>
<p>This year I want it to go differently. Here's what I think was wrong before, and what I'm trying instead.</p>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What Went Wrong</h2>
<p><strong>I treated posts like essays.</strong> An essay takes days to research, draft, and revise. If that's the bar, I'll never ship anything. Most of what I know isn't essay-shaped — it's "here's the thing I figured out this week."</p>
<p><strong>I optimized for an audience I don't have yet.</strong> I'd imagine a reader who already knew a lot, then try to add novelty on top. Better to write for the person I was six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>The tooling got in the way.</strong> A CMS means a login. A complex static site generator means a deploy pipeline to maintain. Friction at the moment of writing is fatal.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-trying-this-time">What I'm Trying This Time</h2>
<p><strong>Low bar for publishing.</strong> If it took me more than an hour to figure something out, it's probably worth a post. It doesn't need to be comprehensive. It just needs to be true and specific.</p>
<p><strong>No scheduling.</strong> I've tried "post every Tuesday." It creates a deadline without a reason. I'd rather write when I have something to say and let the frequency be whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong>Plain Markdown files on disk.</strong> I open a <code>.md</code> file, write, run <code>python build.py</code>, commit. No admin panel, no CMS, no friction. The post is just a file — I can grep it, version it, delete it.</p>
<h2 id="on-audience">On Audience</h2>
<p>The most useful technical posts I've read weren't written for me specifically. They were written by someone who'd been stuck on exactly the problem I had, and they wrote it down so they wouldn't forget.</p>
<p>That's the goal. If future-me (or someone with the same problem) finds this useful, that's enough. The audience doesn't need to be large to make the writing worthwhile.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you're reading this in late 2026, check the post count. That'll tell you whether this actually worked.</p>
